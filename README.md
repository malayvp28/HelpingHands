# Project Name: Helping Hands
## Project Description
The increasing crime rate and the unpredictable nature of daily routines have led to a growing concern for personal safety, particularly for individuals living alone or away from their families. To address this issue, Helping Hands is a mobile application designed to connect users with strangers who are willing to provide assistance in times of need. The application offers various features to ensure user safety and enable mutual support among community members.

## Features
Contact Government Emergency Services: Users can easily contact emergency services such as the police, medical services, or fire services directly through the application.
SOS Alert: In case of an emergency, users can trigger an SOS alert, which will immediately notify user-selected emergency contacts. The application will periodically send the user's live location to the emergency contacts every 50 seconds.
Volunteer Assistance: Users can view a list of available volunteers within their current location range. This feature allows users to seek assistance from nearby volunteers.
Help Requests: Users can broadcast help requests, which will notify nearby volunteers. Volunteers can accept the help request and provide the necessary assistance.
User Account Management: The application supports user account management, allowing users to create and manage their profiles.
## Technology/Tools
The Helping Hands project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

Android Studio: The integrated development environment (IDE) for building the Android application.
Cloud Firebase: A flexible and scalable NoSQL cloud database provided by Google, used to store and manage user data.
Google Maps API Platform: Integration of Google Maps API for location-based features and services.
Java: The primary programming language used for developing the Android application.
XML: The markup language for designing the application's user interface.

## Limitations and Future Extensions
### Limitations
Background processes can be further optimized to improve efficiency and reduce the processing load caused by concurrent thread execution.
### Future Extensions
User interface enhancements: The application's user interface will be improved to provide a more intuitive and interactive experience for users.
Efficiency improvements: Background processes and thread execution will be optimized to reduce processing load and enhance overall performance.
Additional features: Future extensions may include the integration of additional safety features, such as real-time video streaming or audio recording during emergency situations.
Please note that the project is continuously evolving, and the limitations and future extensions mentioned here are subject to change based on the development team's priorities and user feedback.
